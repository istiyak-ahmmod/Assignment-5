### 6. Answer the following questions clearly:

1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

Answer:The primary differences between getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector/querySelectorAll are  

getElementById :Used to bring an element given a specific id.Will return only one element.

getElementsByClassName:Gets all elements of the specified class name.If there are multiple elements, returns them all as an HTMLCollection (similar to an array but not quite an array).

querySelector:Any element can be selected using CSS selector.Returns only the first matching element.

querySelectorAll:Gets all elements that match the CSS selector.Returns them as a NodeList (it's like an array)




2. How do you **create and insert a new element into the DOM**?

Answer: document.createElement("tagName") Will create a new element.
element.innerHTML = "text" You can put whatever you want to write in it.
parent.appendChild(element) Add it to the parent element you want to place it inside.

3. What is **Event Bubbling** and how does it work?

Answer: Event Bubbling is a process where when an event (such as a click) occurs on an element, it first acts on itself, then gradually propagates upwards to its parent, and then its parent.

Meaning â†’ the event starts from the inner child and goes to the outer parent.

4. What is **Event Delegation** in JavaScript? Why is it useful?

Answer: Event delegation is a technique where we place an event listener on the parent element, rather than providing a forward event listener for the child element. The parent can discuss events on a child using event bubbles.

Less code: No need to write separate listeners for multiple child elements.

Better performance: Less memory consumption due to not having multiple event listeners.

Works for dynamic elements: No need to set a separate listener even if a new child element is added to the DOM, it works with the parent's event listener.

5. What is the difference between **preventDefault() and stopPropagation()** methods?

Answer: preventDefault():Disables the default behavior of an element. For example, if a form is submitted and the page reloads, or if a link is clicked and the page is redirected to another page, these can be prevented.

preventDefault():Stops event bubbling or capturing.This means that events will no longer propagate up or down.
